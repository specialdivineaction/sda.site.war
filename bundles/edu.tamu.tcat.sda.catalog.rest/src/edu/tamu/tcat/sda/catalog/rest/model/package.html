Contains data vehicles that define the public RESTful API for various data types. These 
objects should be lightweight, JSON serializable representations of the resources defined 
by the API. Note that they adapt and frequently mirror the underlying data structures 
of the catalog system but do not necessarily provide a one-to-one mapping onto those data
structures. For example, the REST API may define both a summary and detailed representation
of a work.
